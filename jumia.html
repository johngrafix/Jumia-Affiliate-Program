<p>We work with the KOL program for quite some time. From the very beginning, it was and still is a very pleasant journey. Their affiliate panel is neat and clear. We can always count on my account manager who is ready to help and resolve all doubts. We are looking forward to the future partnership and We recommend working with Jumia to anyone.</p>
